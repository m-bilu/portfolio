## Portfolio Website

Hello! This repository holds the current Version 1.0 of my personal portfolio website.

Version 2.0 coming soon. Goals listed in order of priority ->
- Updating text with database backend, to remove hard-coded descriptions
- More interactive cards for each position
    - Organize work cards in a vertical timeline, animate each successive card as it fades in (when u scroll enough)
    - Each work card could allow screenshots to appear on-hover, in a stylized way
    - Description + Screenshots + README + Development Functionality for each card, this info shows on-hover
    - Base all these details from one source (either database or from project README?)
- ANIMATE EVERYTHING!!!
- Link to Medium, Soundcloud, Schoolwork?
- Three.js for image using low-poly blender model of my background pic
- Advancements in colour scheme
- Interactable demos for projects?


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
